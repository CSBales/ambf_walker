To bring up published limb section topics:

rostopic echo /ambf/env/[TAB][TAB]

Segment names are self explanatory save sensor pieces. Base is the swinging piece attached to the impact tab, Tab is the impact tab, and Leg is an expension of the leg section the sensor is attached to for better impact. Tuning needs to be done for object masses and related physical parameters, but joint assignment and other construction should be completed with the simulator working.

TESTING folder contains meshes and .yaml file required to load the model into AMBF. The Blender file is also included for reference and modification.
